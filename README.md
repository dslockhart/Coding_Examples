Sample scripts I have written for my work to automate the extraction and cleaning of data from a local MySQL server.

Orderbook.py is used to open customer xlsx orderbooks and compare to open sales in the server, then write the status of each line back to Excel including tracking numbers where relevant

Components.py is able to search all existing parts for a particular customer by communal raw materials and extract the dimensions of the part.
